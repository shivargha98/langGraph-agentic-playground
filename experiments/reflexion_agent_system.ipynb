Understanding the origins and implications of bias in AI, coupled with effective strategies for identification and mitigation, paves the way for creating more inclusive, equitable, and ethical AI systems that positively impact individuals and society as a whole. It is imperative that we prioritize the development of unbiased and responsible AI to ensure a fair and just future. [...] To comprehend the impact of bias in AI algorithms, we must first understand how biases can seep into these systems. There are several sources of bias in AI, each contributing to different forms of unfairness. Biased data collection is a common cause, where historical imbalances or societal prejudices are reflected in the training data. Additionally, human influence, such as subjective decisions made during data labeling or algorithm design, can also introduce biases.\"}, {\"url\": \"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-023-02079-x\", \"content\": \"While AI recruiting offers numerous benefits, it is also susceptible to algorithmic bias. Algorithmic bias refers to the systematic and replicable errors in computer systems that lead to unequally and discrimination based on legally protected characteristics, such as race and gender (Jackson, 2021 Artificial intelligence & algorithmic bias: the issues with technology reflecting history & humans.

When assessments consistently overestimate or underestimate a [...] Algorithms are not inherently discriminatory, and engineers rarely intentionally introduce bias into algorithms. However, bias can still arise in algorithmic recruitment. This issue is closely linked to the fundamental technology behind AI and ML. The ML process can be simplified into several stages, each involving three key components contributing to algorithmic bias: dataset construction, the engineer\\\\u2019s target formulation, and feature selection (36KE, 2020 From sexism to recruitment [...] indicates that algorithmic bias stems from limited raw data sets and biased algorithm designers. To mitigate this issue, it is recommended to implement technical measures, such as unbiased dataset frameworks and improved algorithmic transparency, as well as management measures like internal corporate ethical governance and external oversight.
